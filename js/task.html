    Moving southwest, the Lesser Caucasus cross the land, stretching on into Armenia, and in the far-south, the <b><i>Thalish Mountains</i></b> help form its border with Iran. <br/>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A low flood plain covers the south-central and east, ending at the <font color="green">Caspian Sea</font>; much of it below sea level. Baku, the capital city, sits on the Abseron Yasaqligi
